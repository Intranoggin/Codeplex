The Net project and Net.dll come from an open source project on www.codeproject.com called NetPopMimeClient.
Get it and learn more about it here:
http://www.codeproject.com/KB/IP/NetPopMimeClient.aspx

I've added the full code directly to this solution because some users were getting 
errors inside the Net.dll code and it was difficult for them to debug it as a seperate project.
